He captured priceless action shots, worked closely with us to execute our ideas, and scoped out the scenery on sites to carefully choose photo locations. Dan paid close attention to lighting and performed beautiful editing to enhance coloring and create timeless effects in our photos... We\'ll be returning to Wine Guy Photography for all of our future life events requiring photography. We trust Dan to take the best photos for us and our family to cherish forever! We also love his friendly, down-to-earth personality and sincere willingness to go out of his way to deliver amazing photo outcomes!',

His experience led to many beautiful shots that were dreamt up by his passion for photography, rather than beautifying a point and shoot. While his skill and quality are that of a professional, he was personally invested on a much more individual level, even going out and purchasing additional materials (at no small cost) in order to fulfill a more artistic vision. Dan is a fantastic photographer and was the perfect choice for my fianc√© and I. While the pictures that we requested were fantastic, it was the pictures where we let him run with it that produced the most frame-able moments. He CANNOT be beaten for the price, and we would use him again in a heartbeat',
